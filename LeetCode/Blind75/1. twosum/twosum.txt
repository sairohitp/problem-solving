return the index values of the array
whose sum will result in the target

mentioned that only one solution exists

fix one value of the array
add the remaining elements to that fixed value
see if the sum matches the target

if yes, return the index
if not,
    increment the iterator pointing at the constant value to the next value
    add the new constat value and add the numbers that come after it
    check again
