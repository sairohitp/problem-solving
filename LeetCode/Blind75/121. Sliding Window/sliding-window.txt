buy low, sell high

array with
days as the index 
price is the value on index

while (array not overrun) {
    if ((low < high) == positive) {
        profit = high - low
        calc maximum of profit vs. prevmax
    } else {
        increment pointer to array
    }
}
return max

approach
find and store the lowest first
find the max element from the given lowest value


initialise two pointers
left pointer
right pointer

since time moves only in one direction
i.e iteration to happen only in right / forward direction

rp will be right of lp

if lp - rp = negative, increment lp
if lp - rp = positive, increment rp and subtract from lp, stroe the profit in max profit
repeat above steps till subtracted value croses max profit
